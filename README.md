# Command Line Search Engine

> Command line C++ program that simulates a search engine with a page ranking algorithm.

## Description

A simple C++ program that simulates a working search engine. It reads from 3 CSV files and uses C++ data structures and algorithms that promote low code complexity. It loads the website data from the CSV files, calculates the ranking according to the PageRank algorithm, indexes the websites according to scope, and allows you to simulate then searching via the command line and the opening of websites to increase the number of impressions. This was done as the final project of the Analysis and Design Of Algorithms Lab (CSCE 2203).

## Features

- Loads the website data from CSV files for ease of use.
- Ranks the websites according to Google's PageRank algorithm.
- Allows searching for keywords.
- Returns results and updates impressions.
- Simulates the opening of websites to modify impressions for a more realistic outcome.

## Getting Started

- Run the `AADLProject` file in any C++ compiler and make sure that the `WebGraph`, `WebIMP`, and `WebKeyword` CSV files are in the same folder.
